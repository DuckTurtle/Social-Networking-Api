# Social Network API

## Description

I created this project ot practice monogodb connection along with mongoose routes practice.  These two programs allow me to better practice creating my own apis. for this situation I created  an api that could be used for a social networking program. Durring this project I learned how to use mongoose to create models and routes  in a more efficent way.
